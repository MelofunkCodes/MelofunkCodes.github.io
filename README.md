## Welcome to my webpage! ##
link: https://MelofunkCodes.github.io/

Here you can find more information about me, my skills, projects I've worked on (links to their demos), education, and work experience.

This website was built using just HTML5 and CSS. I made it responsive, so it can be viewed on any screen: mobile, tablet, laptops, and beyond! (Although beyond *might* be a bit too much...). Enjoy! :)
